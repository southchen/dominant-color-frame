## Overview

This tool solves a common problem for photographers and content creators: maintaining visual consistency when uploading images with different aspect ratios to social media platforms.

Instead of letting platforms crop your carefully composed photos, this app automatically frames them with a border using the image's dominant color, creating a cohesive and professional look.

## Problem Statement

When uploading photos with different aspect ratios (3:4, 16:9, etc.) and orientations to social media:
- Images appear misaligned in feeds
- Platforms may crop photos, destroying the original composition
- Visual consistency is lost across your content

## Solution

Frame each image with its dominant color to:
- âœ¨ Maintain original composition
- ðŸŽ¨ Create visual harmony across different aspect ratios
- ðŸ“± Ensure consistent appearance on social media feeds

## Features

- **Pure Frontend**: No server required, runs entirely in the browser
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Minimal dependencies (only Semantic UI for styling)
- **Batch Processing**: Upload and process multiple images at once
- **Batch Download**: Download all processed images as a ZIP file
- **Shadow Toggle**: Optional drop shadow effect for enhanced visual appeal
- **Real-time Preview**: See results instantly as you upload

## Technical Implementation

- **FileReader API**: For client-side file handling
- **Canvas API**: For image processing and dominant color extraction
- **Promise-based**: Asynchronous file processing with proper error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Usage
